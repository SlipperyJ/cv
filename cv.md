## <a name="About">About me</a>
I am a former IT sales professional with a passion for building applications and solving complex problems through code. Computing absolutely fascinates me,
being able to model the real world and simulate physical relationships between real things, through code, is something I never get tired of thinking about.
A year and a half ago, I came to the realisation that not only could I code for a living but I could be great at it too. So I refocused my efforts,
enrolled in and completed software development courses at the Open University and at Makers Academy to further my dream - of doing what I love, every day.

#### Business / Sales / Teamwork
I have a wide range of sales, business and marketing experience from a 10 year career working closely with
marketing teams, directors and clients. Throughout my career I have managed sales teams and have grown start-ups and new product
ranges into successful businesses.

#### Quick Learner
For my final project with Makers Academy, [Run to Riches], we developed a native mobile app, picking up Java and
JUnit for the first time. We succeeded in producing our initial vision through teamwork and dedication in under 2 weeks. Additionally team [Stockr] implemented a MVP that a wholesaler was able to start using in production in just
3 days.
